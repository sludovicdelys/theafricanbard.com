        <p id= "across-ocean"> I am at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport exchanging a few words with a young Venezuelan man, roughly the same age as me, traveling with his family from London. He has not been home in six years. “If you like hiking you will love Venezuela!”. He does not seem as nervous as me, yet he is. “A lot of things change in six years”, I softly say to him. He nods, and for a few seconds, zone out, staring between his feet. I know the feeling way too well and prefer not to press further. I did not mean to put him in an uncomfortable situation, so I thought it was divine timing when his group was called. <br>
            <br>Growing up in West Africa a mixed race woman I had been a tourist at home and a foreigner outside countless of times. I still vividly remember the day I was called out for “cultural appropriation” while parading around in long slender box braids. I had no reason to doubt my identity but I still developed feelings of inadequacy. Years later, I had fostered a deep need to prove my allegiance to the motherland. In my search for belonging and acceptance, I dedicated my post graduate years towards the exploration of the African continent’s impact on world history, and insisted on spreading the knowledge. <br> 
            <br>As the passengers start to queue near the emergency exit door of the aircraft someone bumps into my heel. “Lo siento”, it is the shy and raspy voice of a man. I want to say “It’s okay”, but thought that my poor knowledge of the Spanish language would make this very awkward. I stood motionless and waited for movement in my line.  
            <br>At the back of the aircraft, I find an old lady firmly gripping a blue tote bag. A baby size teddy bear sneaking out of it, sprouts smiles whenever the passengers and the crew's eyes wander upon it. She asks me if I need to cross towards the window seat. I know that the alley is the one I booked, but I do not insist. Gracias, I respond timidly as I squeeze myself across her knees. My flight companion's kindness throughout the trip make the hours pass quickly. I regret deeply not having the linguistic ability to thank her for helping me find a non-existent USB plug and sharing her snacks. I want to isolate myself as a punishment for my lack. Still, she speaks slowly with patience only acquired by the resilience that a long life can give. <br>
            <br>Evila is on her way to visit her family and friends. There is only one flight to Caracas, and it departs from Paris, so she is tired and eager to get home. She still has to drive to Valencia, her final destination. As we approach, a flight attendant starts to distribute immigration forms, my travel companion’s smile slowly fades as she turns the page to complete her reading. She brought medicine from Portugal to her friends. She worries that the immigration officers will take them away upon landing. Medicine is costly. She stares at the Venezuelan shore. <br>
            <br>I did a fair bit of research before deciding to embark on this trip. I take precaution because it is en environment I do not know. Also, I believe that even if my father work has given me permission to enter this delicate space, the very fact that I am a foreigner excludes me from fully experience and grasp the life of the local population. I must respect them lives first before my very own. As I was listening to my flight companion, I remembered reading about  34 years old Andreína who spent five months scrapping whatever she could at the border city of Cúcuta. Earning as little as two dollars a day for working six to nine hours shift. Whatever she saved she sent to her six children in Barlovento, a centre of African culture in Venezuela. <br>  
            <br>There is a story behind how humanity treats and has treated people of darker skin colours in societies of all kind. That is the story I seek to know. What did happened to the African slaves that crossed this vast ocean and landed in South America? Who are they now? <br>
            <br>“Hey! Where are you going? You are so beautiful! I feel a loud thud in my chest. A loud manly voice, has interrupted my thinking as I was walking down the alley towards the bathroom. A white man wobbles next to his seat and smiles in my direction. I recover from the surprise. Most likely drunk. I can feel my core fuming with heat. I feel disgraced but I also feel vulnerable from the comment. Should I curse him out? Should I stare angrily at him? Should I publicly embarrass him? I do nothing. I spend the rest of my day feeling responsible for perpetuating this form of harassment. My inertness may make other women after me fall victim to that same man. <br> 
            <br>We disembark moments later. My father waits just above the escalator and I quickly find myself in his warm embrace. He has been pushing to do this trip for months. I greet and introduce myself to Jefferson, the official driver, and a hostess from the diplomatic lounge who seems like she has been waiting far longer than she wanted. Once she lets go of my hand she gestures towards the hall where we follow her. As we walk past the immigration office desk I briefly spot Evila in the queues. <br>
            <br>The diplomatic lounge of the Simon Bolivar International Airport graced a marble floor so sumptuous that for one second, I felt I was making the floor dirtier. There are leather seats, and couches spread out across the room and assembled in some square, shaped by the vivid Persian style carpet. A few chandeliers, pot plants, and glossy wooden tables. What caught my eye first was the multicoloured, floor to ceiling, glass mosaic. However, I looked longer at large paintings of Simon Bolivar, Hugo Chavez, and Nicolas Maduro. There was also a furnished outdoor balcony that looked like a beach restaurant, an aquarium, and a small statue of Mary enclaved inside a stone wall. <br>
            <br>The airport opened in 1945 and was visited multiple times by the Concorde until the 1980s. Due to the ongoing crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, many international airlines have left the country. A testament to international glory. “It is beautiful right ?”. My father relaxes into a big leather seat. I look around and slowly sinks into the large black cushion. “I like the mosaïc, the rest is a bit over the top”. <br>
            <br>Outside the air is hot and heavy, but still so pleasant. The mountains are gigantic and plenty. I remember Evila's comment about the lack of agricultural entrepreneurship towards this abundant and untouched land. <br>
            <br>At the edge of Caracas, I briefly notice two or three groups of people, with plastic water bottles of different sizes in their hands. “Jefferson was born and raised in one of the surrounding barrios; you could visit with him if you'd like”, my father proposes. I am not too fond on the idea, it feels impudent. Mainly, because it must be deeply private and difficult to have a foreigner walking about your home like a touristic site. Jefferson barely said a word throughout the entire drive. It was hard to find any emotion on his face, but he seemed content. <br>
            <br>In Caracas, food trucks are lined up along Plaza Francia. Almost 80% of Latin Americans live in urbanised regions. With the crisis, food supplies are more plentiful in Caracas, but only for those who have access to it. <br>
            <br>More marble floors inside the reception of Altamira Suites. There is a young man at the reception. My father greets him in Spanish. “Buenas, Cómo estás? Es mi hija”, my father smile widen. "Hello. Welcome”. I slightly twitched, as I was not expecting an answer in English. The suite has two large bedroom, a living room, marble kitchen, green carpet, and a very large view of the mountains. Before I get too lost taking in the green walls, my father interrupts. “There is a better view upstairs. Let’s go”. <br>
            <br>We head up through the emergency stairs to the 360. It's a bar-restaurant that also serves as a night club. I order a Salto Angel pizza. I secretly hope that it tastes as good as the world's highest waterfall. The rooftop bar is still being set up for the night, but since my father comes here often, the manager lets us climb further. From up here, I can see the gigantic mountains surrounding the town. They make the buildings look like they were built inside a massive tropical jungle. The music played is similar to Afro-House, the furniture is sober and urban looking but find that shining a few party lights to the nearby buildings is a really nice touch. “Cathy is on her way to pick us up”, warns my father. I barely have time to savour my pizza, but I will never forget the warm garlic filled cheese melting off the crust.<br>  
            <br>Cathy is finishing her masters in indigenous pharmaceutics. Tomorrow, she has to present her thesis and the products she has developed to treat common herpes. Cathy loves to travel, and still remembers her trip to Egypt. Luz, her mother, was struggling to fund her studies until she started working as an assistant. Luz used to be very anxious in the past, as her past executive would frequently make her feel like her position was in jeopardy. As a result, she had a car accident, and underwent few surgeries. Presently, she rehabilitate her arm with weekly reeducation sessions. My father mentions that Venezuelans were once so wealthy that some of them used to fly out to Miami on Fridays to go shopping. If they bought a pair of shoes, they would more than often buy a second pair. Dame dos! <br>
            <br>Cathy drops us back at Altamira. She promises to give me a tour of the city after she finishes her thesis presentation. We head back to the rooftop for some more food. At that point, my brain is hazy from the jet lag, and my reaction time starts to slow. People are having discussions around me, but I am tunnel driving my thoughts toward my diary to stay awake. I note down that I struggle to distinguish social and cultural differences. It might make my quest more tedious. Walking through a muddy, green, and thick jungle. When we finally head back to the apartment, I jump in bed fully dressed. <br>
