        <p>Whenever I speak about growing abroad, most of my listeners respond with dreamy eyes and longing sighs the words, <em>"You are so lucky."</em> At first, I would say thank you and anticipate the follow-up question, <em>"What do your parents do?"</em>. I've noticed quickly that my answer influenced greatly how others perceive me and behave around me.<br>
        
        <br>When I was in my twenties, I had my first identity crisis and learned about the term <em>'Third Culture Kid'</em> for the first time. <strong>TCKs are individuals or children raised in a culture other than their parents' or/and their country of nationality</strong>; they live in various environments during their early developmental years.<br>
        
        <br> At the time, I refrained from talking about my childhood because I wanted to seem <em>'normal'</em>. I was armed with new knowledge on the psychological obstacles of this lifestyle; I  could finally put meaning and words to my flawed self. <strong>Still, I was unprepared for this next revelation.</strong><br>
        
        <br>I was learning lines for a school play when I made the acquaintance of a student scriptwriter waiting for his crew meeting to start. Without introduction, he asked where I was from. I gave her an ambiguous answer about being an African of mixed ancestry. Eventually, <strong>He asked so many questions</strong> about my upbringing that, in irritation, I blurted angrily, <em>"It is not always nice being a stranger."</em> He was surprised at my reaction but responded with a smile, <em>"I know, but that means you are adaptable"</em>.

        <p>To this day, I still struggle to understand how this aspect of my life is valuable. A couple of months ago, my partner had suggested that I start learning how to code. I would spend a few minutes learning JavaScript on Khan Academy whenever the hotel was quiet enough to listen to the videos undisturbed. I enjoyed playing video games since I was little and so I was curious; I wanted to look at the world of computer programming differently.   <br>
        
        <br>I quickly realized that the customer service industry was not a suitable career for me. I was too empathetic to stand up for myself when clients were abusive. This kind of work environment was toxic, and I dragged myself home every late night, eyes filled with tears. Moreover, I was under an immense amount of stress. I was multitasking various tasks that were often related to technical difficulties, such as broken elevators with clients stuck in them.   <br>
        
        <br>I had just quit my job as a receptionist. I was ecstatic about landing a career as a travel advisor for a big company when the French government launched the first quarantine procedures to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The recruitment process was closed, and the tourism industry plummeted. "I was so close to my dream job," I mourned. <br>
        
        <br> Today I am unemployed, but I spend a lot of time meditating and reassuring myself that my situation is not as bad as it seems. However, I still have frequent anxious moments when I feel like my world is going to explode. Amidst the turbulence of life, I continued to learn to code, and I am grateful for it. My days feel less worthless, and I tell myself that I am learning something valuable, while still pushing strong through difficulties.
