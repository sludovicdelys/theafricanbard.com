            <p>
                I woke up at sunrise feeling the effects of jet lag still lingering in my body, despite the sleeping pill from last night. I cooked up a copious breakfast with what I could find in the kitchen—eggs with avocado on toast, fruits, and a bit of cereal. I had to fill up for the day’s visit to Colonia Tovar, a small German village enclaved in the beautiful mountainside setting of Aragua state.<br>
                <br>Down at the lobby of the hotel I made acquaintances with Felipe, Valentina and Sofia; we shared a ride for the day while my father traveled with Thomas and Soraya. Felipe worked with my father, and Valentina introduced herself as a trained teacher with a deep love for painting. Sofia, who was sitting on my right, was the same age as me. Valentina explained that if we needed to stop to go to the bathroom, we could stop anytime. “I only have baby wipes because-“, she stopped mid sentence and briefly turned away from the wheel to Sofia, "You know why”. Indeed, no paper toilet, or at least hard to find. Halfway up, we noticed a few paraglider jumping off cliffs. The costs was 30$ for one ride. “Would you jump”? I asked Sofia. Her eyes widened and she laughed. “Only if you go first!”.<br> 
                <br>They were a lot of horses on the road, perhaps because it was easier for farmers to travel through the hills or for tourist attractions. Sofia opened up as we reached the peak of the mountains. She had finished high-school six years ago and was not able to fund her way to university. “I live with my ‘abuela’ in one of the barrios around Caracas, I teach Spanish at the moment, I can speak French and I am learning Chinese” she said humbly. “That’s amazing”, shouted Felipe. Indeed we were all impressed. My father told me he was introduced to her by Alexander, a friend who used to work for the UK's Secret Intelligent Services.<br>
                <br>I inspected multiple times Sofia’s silky long black hair, almond eyes and fair skin before I finally mustered up the courage to ask what is her ethnic background. “My biological grandmother is black like an African!”, she said proudly. Looking at her, I found it extremely hard to believe because I was expecting some Asian ancestry. Valentina explained in a very instructional tone that most of the Venezuelan population is mestizo, meaning of mixed race background. “We’re all the same, all mixed”, she concluded. Sofia’s smile faded but then quickly regained its light once she returned to our conversation. “My grandmother; she has Afro hair, ‘pelo malo’ as everyone calls it”. “What does it mean?”, I asked. She leaned forward and slightly lowered her voice. It means ‘bad hair’.<br>
                <br>While the vehicle was climbing up the steepest roads the passengers stared deeply into the jungle, lost in thoughts. I liked these moments during long car rides. I searched in my mind the moment that led me to grabbing my very first pair of irons with the firm intention of taking ‘control’ of the wildness in my hair. It was a Senegalese hair dresser who snapped me back to self acceptance. I was in high school and needed to cut long strands because I had literally fried them after straightening my hair every day for a full week with olive oil. “You have beautiful curls, you need to stop hurting them”, she said as she stared deeply into my eyes through the mirror. Today my hair is the thing I love most about myself. I learned that I was constantly guided by societal standards to oppress my body rather than accept it. Many still feel this way, and Afro-descendants are certainly not excluded.<br> 
                <br>We get stopped a couple of times for security reasons, but nothing to fuss about. Except for a few kilometres later, when Valentina noticed that the line of cars was much longer. Felipe lowered his window and took a peek. He looked uneasy. “This is weird”. Suddenly, the music stopped. Valentina had turned it off. She nervously brushed her blond hair away from her face with her sunglasses. “You didn't have to turn it off. We're not doing anything wrong”, Felipe protested.<br> 
                <br>Twelve soldiers were surrounding the area this time, all of them had their faces covered except for two on either side of the road checking inside vehicles. They were carrying heavyweight guns—nothing like a hand pistol. The traffic started to speed up. “They did not find who or what they were looking for,” said Valentina with a hint of relief. We drove past; no one asked us questions. From the corner of my eye, I noticed two snipers hiding on top of an unfinished concrete building. I could not even see their eyes. Once the moment passed, we turned the music back on. There was a tense atmosphere, but we continued our trip. “We must move on because that is the only thing we can do when we feel powerless”, said Valentina.<br> 
                <br>One thousand and eight hundred meters up in the forests of Cordillera de la Costa, we arrived in Colonia Tovar. White houses with timbers and red roofs surrounded by flower gardens, carefully tended fields and creeks with water mills. The town, founded in 1843 by a group of 300 odd immigrants after an agreement between the government of Venezuela and Germany, was relatively unknown for the first 100 years. This isolation allowed them to retain their ancestral traditions and gradually grew more sufficient over the years. Their primary source of livelihood came from selling produce, coffee, and other good to neighbouring towns. This activity allowed them to learn Spanish while keeping to themselves. During World War II, the war declared on Germany rose the suspicions of government officials. So, roads were improved so officials could travel to and from Colonia Tovar with ease. Spanish was established as the official language, and German was banned.<br> 
                <br>With a population of roughly fifteen thousand, Colonia Tovar is considered one of the country's most prosperous towns in terms of economy and quality of life due to their integration combined with cultural preservation. The culture shock was quite disorienting. “I did take a plane for South America, right?”, I jokingly asked the group. However, my growly stomach stole my full attention as I could not help but salivate on the smell of hearty German cuisine of sausage and sauerkraut -German pickled cabbage- lingering in the air. We parked the cars and marched to the Hotel Bergland for lunch.<br> 
                <br>Soraya, the Lebanese security advisor sat in front of me. Her long wavy hair seemed familiar; my father reminded me that I participated in women's security and emergency response training, where she mentored a self-defence and crisis management workshop.  Thomas was on my right, quiet until we started discussing our encounter with the heavily armed patrol. They were driving ahead of us. He was just as skeptical about our encounter and believed some of them were Colombian soldiers. To finish our meals, we sipped through a hot espresso to fight the urge to nap and headed towards the food market.<br> 
                <br>The village had installed stalls with local fruits, vegetables, cookies, and sweets. There was even the famous Willy Wonka, waving at visitors with a golden ticket in his hands. We stopped by a souvenir shop, and a sunflower wind-chime caught my attention. The shop owner took an old geometry book and tore some pages to wrap our gifts. “I never cared for mathematics”; she laughed. She quickly noticed my careful silence and asked me if I was a foreigner. “We came from Caracas”, Sofia intercepted. “It is best to be discreet, not many foreign tourists at the moment”, she whispered in my ear as we quickly but respectfully left the shop.<br> 
                <br>Our way down the mountains was obstructed by a thick fog. The side streets were more animated than earlier. Young adults were waving meat skewers, and we drove past a few stands offering alcoholic beverages. The traffic got busy. It was Sunday afternoon, everyone was heading home and savouring the last bits of the weekend. Sofia, my father, and I were dropped off at the hotel. Valentina suggested that we walk down to Altamira Plaza to try some of the food trucks stationed there. “Platanos are the best!” She waved and drove off. Sofia was more than happy to accompany me.<br> 
                <br>El Topocho's design immediately attracted my eye. It was a matte black truck covered with large paintings of banana tree leaves. Sofia and myself followed Valentina's suggestion, and we ordered a box of six ‘plataconcitos’. The recipe was simple enough. The plantains were deep-fried, shaped into cups, and packed with different kinds of fillings. My favourite was the guacamole because it was lighter than the others. The plaza was busy, and my father who started to get worried, joined us minutes later, before we walked back together. The sun was setting, so we avoided looking around as we moved towards the hotel with purpose and the most unsuspicious fast pace we could do.<br>
