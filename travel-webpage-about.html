                <h2>Where it all beganâ€¦</h2>

                <p>Like millions of people around the world, I was unprepared for the insurmountable obstacle that is Covid-19.<br> 
                    <br>I was in the process of becoming a customer advisor for a luxury travel agency and was ready to sign my name in blood if it meant I could spend the rest of my life living my wildest wanderlust dreams.<br> 
                    <br>I thought I had finally found my true calling. All these years spent roaming around the world, meeting a multitude of cultures and navigating a wide variety of social spaces, would finally help me feel useful and valuable.<br>  
                    <br>Nonetheless, life has its own plan. In March 2020, I was confined in a small Parisian studio for months. Jobless, hopeless and unable to walk outside longer than 60 minutes; I watched videos and images of my trip to Venezuela. I was mourning a part of my freedom.<br>    
                    <br>Angry at everything, I took it upon myself to learn programming because I thought if there was one thing the world could no longer function without is the Internet and the devices that surround us.<br> 
                    <br>This is a personal project, a testament to my willingness and ability to dance through the winds of change.<br>  
                    <br>All the content as well as the webpage itself is my own work. I hope to inspire, but most importantly I hope it encourages you, the reader, to rediscover yourself and redefine your talents, skills and sense of self. </p>
