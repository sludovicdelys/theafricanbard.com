'Confined across the ocean',

'I was at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport exchanging a few words with a young Venezuelan man, roughly the same age as me, traveling with his family from London. He had not been home in six years. “If you like hiking you will love Venezuela!”. He did not seem as nervous as me, yet he was. “A lot of things change in six years”, I softly said to him. He nodded, zoned out for a few seconds, staring between his feet. I knew the feeling way too well and preferred not to press further. I did not mean to put him in an uncomfortable situation, so I thought it was divine timing when his group was called.
Growing up a mixed race woman in West Africa, I had been a tourist at home and a foreigner outside countless of times. I still vividly remember the day I was called out for “cultural appropriation” while parading around in long slender box braids. I had no reason to doubt my identity but I still developed feelings of inadequacy. Years later, I had fostered a deep need to prove my allegiance to the motherland. In my search for belonging and acceptance, I dedicated my post graduate years towards the exploration of the African continent’s impact on world history, and insisted on spreading the knowledge. 
As the passengers started to queue near the emergency exit door of the aircraft, someone bumped into my heel. “Lo siento”. I heard the shy and raspy voice of a man. I wanted to say “It’s okay”, but I thought that my poor knowledge of the Spanish language would make this very awkward. Instead, I stood motionless and waited for movement in my line.  
At the back of the aircraft, I met an old lady firmly gripping a blue tote bag. A baby size teddy bear sneaking out of it, sprouted smiles whenever the passengers and the crew''s eyes wandered upon it. She asked me if I needed to cross towards the window seat. I knew that she was in my seat, but I did not insist. Gracias, I responded timidly as I squeezed myself across her knees. My flight companion''s kindness throughout the trip made the hours pass quickly. I deeply regretted  not having the linguistic ability to thank her for helping me look for a non-existent USB plug and sharing her snacks. I wanted to isolate myself, as a punishment for being unable to easily communicate with her. Still, she spoke slowly with patience only acquired by the resilience that a long life can give. 
Evila was on her way to visit her family and friends. There is only one flight to Caracas, and it departed from Paris, so she was tired and eager to get home. As we approached, a flight attendant started to distribute immigration forms, my travel companion’s smile slowly faded as she turned the page to complete her reading. She brought medicine from Portugal to her friends. She’s worried that the immigration officers will take them away upon landing. “Medicine is costly”. She stared longly at the Venezuelan shore. 
I had done a fair bit of research before deciding to embark on this trip. I took precaution because it is en environment I do not know. Also, I believed that even if my father’s work had given me the permission to enter this delicate space, the very fact that I am a foreigner excluded me from fully experiencing and understanding the life of the local population. I must respect their lives first before my very own. As I was listening to my flight companion, I remembered reading about 34 years old Andreína who spent five months scrapping whatever she could at the border city of Cúcuta. Earning as little as two dollars a day for working six to nine hours shift. Whatever she saved she sent to her six children in Barlovento, a centre of African culture in Venezuela. 
There is a story behind how humanity treats and has treated people of darker skin colours in societies of all kind. That is the story I seek answers about. What did happen to the African slaves that crossed this vast ocean and landed in South America? Who are their descendants? 
“Hey! Where are you going? You are so beautiful! I felt a loud thud in my chest. A loud manly voice, interrupted my thinking as I was walking down the alley towards the bathroom. A white man wobbled next to his seat and smiled in my direction. I recovered from the surprise. Most likely drunk. I could feel my core fuming with heat. I felt disgraced and vulnerable. Should I curse him out? Should I stare angrily at him? Should I publicly embarrass him? I did nothing. I spent the rest of my day feeling responsible for perpetuating this form of harassment. My inertness may make other women after me fall victim to that same man. 
We disembarked moments later. My father waited just above the escalator and I quickly found myself in his warm embrace. He has been pushing for me to do this trip for months. I greeted and introduced myself to Jefferson, the official driver, and a hostess from the diplomatic lounge who seemed like she had been waiting far longer than she wanted. Once she let go of my hand she gestured towards the hall where we followed her. As we walked past the immigration office desk I briefly spotted Evila in the queues. 
The diplomatic lounge of the Simon Bolivar International Airport boasts a marble floor so sumptuous that for one second, I felt I was making the floor dirtier. There were leather seats, and couches spread out across the room and assembled in square forms, shaped by the vivid Persian style carpet. I took quick inventory of a few chandeliers, pot plants, and glossy wooden tables. What you cannot miss when walking in this room is the multicolored, floor to ceiling, glass mosaic. However, I looked longer at large paintings of Simon Bolivar, Hugo Chavez, and Nicolas Maduro. There was also a furnished outdoor balcony that looked like a beach restaurant, an aquarium, and a small statue of Mary enclaved inside a stone wall. 
The airport opened in 1945 and was visited multiple times by the Concorde until the 1980s. Due to the ongoing crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, many international airlines have left the country.“It is beautiful right ?”. My father relaxed into a big leather seat. I looked around and slowly sunk into the large black cushion. “I like the mosaic, the rest is a bit over the top”.
Outside the air was hot and heavy, but still so pleasant. The mountains were gigantic and plenty. I remembered Evila''s comment about the lack of agricultural entrepreneurship in this abundant and untouched land. 
At the edge of Caracas, I briefly noticed two or three groups of people, with plastic water bottles of different sizes in their hands. “Jefferson was born and raised in one of the surrounding barrios; you could visit with him if you''d like”, my father proposed. I was not too fond of the idea, it felt invasive. I thought it would be deeply private and difficult to have a foreigner walking about your home like a touristic site. Jefferson barely said a word throughout the entire drive. It was hard to find any emotion on his face, but he seemed content. 
In Caracas, food trucks were lined up along Plaza Francia. Almost 80% of Latin Americans currently live in urbanised regions. With the crisis, food supplies were more plentiful in Caracas, but only for those who had access to it. 
More marble floors inside the reception of Altamira Suites. We walked towards a young man standing at the reception counter. My father greeted him in Spanish. “Buenas, Cómo estás? Es mi hija”, his smile widened. "Hello. Welcome”. I slightly twitched, as I was not expecting an answer in English. The suite had two large bedroom, a living room, marble kitchen, green carpet, and a very large view of the mountains. Before I got too lost taking in the green walls, my father interrupted. “There is a better view upstairs. Let’s go”. 
We climbed the emergency stairs to the 360, a bar-restaurant that also served as a night club. I ordered a Salto Angel pizza. I secretly hoped that it was as impressive as the eponymous waterfall. From the rooftop, I could see the gigantic mountains surrounding the town. They made the buildings look like they were built inside a massive tropical jungle. The music played was similar to Afro-House, the furniture sober and urban looking. I found that shining a few party lights to the nearby buildings was a really nice touch. “Carolina is on her way to pick us up”, warned my father. I barely had time to savour my pizza, but I still remember the warm garlic filled cheese melting off the crust. 
Carolina was finishing her masters in indigenous pharmaceutics. She explained that she would present her thesis during the week, alongside the cosmetics she has developed to treat common herpes. Carolina who loves to travel, still vividly remembered her trip to Egypt. Daniela, her mother, was struggling to fund her studies until she started working as an assistant. Daniela used to be very anxious in the past, as her previous employer would frequently make her feel like her position was in jeopardy. As a result, she had a car accident, and underwent few surgeries. When we met, she was rehabilitating her arm with weekly reeducation sessions. My father mentioned that Venezuelans were once so wealthy that some of them used to fly out to Miami on Fridays to go shopping. If they bought a pair of shoes, they would more than often buy a second pair. “Dame dos!”. 
Carolina dropped us back at Altamira. She promised to give me a tour of the city after her thesis presentation. We returned to the rooftop for a quick dinner. At that point, my brain was hazy from the jet lag, and my reaction time started to slow. People were having discussions around me, but I was tunnel driving my thoughts toward my diary to stay awake longer. I noted down that I struggled to distinguish social and cultural differences. “It might make my quest more tedious, like walking through a muddy, green, and thick jungle”. When we finally got back to the apartment, I jumped in my bed fully dressed.'

'Pelo mano means bad hair',

'I woke up at sunrise feeling the effects of jet lag still lingering in my body, despite the sleeping pill from last night. I cooked up a copious breakfast with what I could find in the kitchen—eggs with avocado on toast, fruits, and a bit of cereal. I had to fill up for the day’s visit to Colonia Tovar, a small German village enclaved in the beautiful mountainside setting of Aragua state.
Down at the lobby of the hotel I made acquaintances with Felipe, Valentina and Sofia; we shared a ride for the day while my father traveled with Thomas and Soraya. Felipe worked with my father, and Valentina introduced herself as a trained teacher with a deep love for painting. Sofia, who was sitting on my right, was the same age as me. Valentina explained that if we needed to stop to go to the bathroom, we could stop anytime. “I only have baby wipes because-“, she stopped mid sentence and briefly turned away from the wheel to Sofia, "You know why”. Indeed, no paper toilet, or at least hard to find. Halfway up, we noticed a few paraglider jumping off cliffs. The costs was 30$ for one ride. “Would you jump”? I asked Sofia. Her eyes widened and she laughed. “Only if you go first!”. 
They were a lot of horses on the road, perhaps because it was easier for farmers to travel through the hills or for tourist attractions. Sofia opened up as we reached the peak of the mountains. She had finished high-school six years ago and was not able to fund her way to university. “I live with my ‘abuela’ in one of the barrios around Caracas, I teach Spanish at the moment, I can speak French and I am learning Chinese” she said humbly. “That’s amazing”, shouted Felipe. Indeed we were all impressed. My father told me he was introduced to her by Alexander, a friend who used to work for the UK''s Secret Intelligent Services.
I inspected multiple times Sofia''s silky long black hair, almond eyes and fair skin before I finally mustered up the courage to ask what is her ethnic background. “My biological grandmother is black like an African!”, she said proudly. Looking at her, I found it extremely hard to believe because I was expecting some Asian ancestry. Valentina explained in a very instructional tone that most of the Venezuelan population is mestizo, meaning of mixed race background. “We’re all the same, all mixed”, she concluded. Sofia’s smile faded but then quickly regained its light once she returned to our conversation. “My grandmother; she has Afro hair, ‘pelo malo’ as everyone calls it”. “What does it mean?”, I asked. She leaned forward and slightly lowered her voice. It means ‘bad hair’.
While the vehicle was climbing up the steepest roads the passengers stared deeply into the jungle, lost in thoughts. I liked these moments during long car rides. I searched in my mind the moment that led me to grabbing my very first pair of irons with the firm intention of taking ‘control’ of the wildness in my hair. It was a Senegalese hair dresser who snapped me back to self acceptance. I was in high school and needed to cut long strands because I had literally fried them after straightening my hair every day for a full week with olive oil. “You have beautiful curls, you need to stop hurting them”, she said as she stared deeply into my eyes through the mirror. Today my hair is the thing I love most about myself. I learned that I was constantly guided by societal standards to oppress my body rather than accept it. Many still feel this way, and Afro-descendants are certainly not excluded. 
We get stopped a couple of times for security reasons, but nothing to fuss about. Except for a few kilometres later, when Valentina noticed that the line of cars was much longer. Felipe lowered his window and took a peek. He looked uneasy. “This is weird”. Suddenly, the music stopped. Valentina had turned it off. She nervously brushed her blond hair away from her face with her sunglasses. “You didn''t have to turn it off. We''re not doing anything wrong”, Felipe protested. 
Twelve soldiers were surrounding the area this time, all of them had their faces covered except for two on either side of the road checking inside vehicles. They were carrying heavyweight guns—nothing like a hand pistol. The traffic started to speed up. “They did not find who or what they were looking for,” said Valentina with a hint of relief. We drove past; no one asked us questions. From the corner of my eye, I noticed two snipers hiding on top of an unfinished concrete building. I could not even see their eyes. Once the moment passed, we turned the music back on. There was a tense atmosphere, but we continued our trip. “We must move on because that is the only thing we can do when we feel powerless”, said Valentina. 
One thousand and eight hundred meters up in the forests of Cordillera de la Costa, we arrived in Colonia Tovar. White houses with timbers and red roofs surrounded by flower gardens, carefully tended fields and creeks with water mills. The town, founded in 1843 by a group of 300 odd immigrants after an agreement between the government of Venezuela and Germany, was relatively unknown for the first 100 years. This isolation allowed them to retain their ancestral traditions and gradually grew more sufficient over the years. Their primary source of livelihood came from selling produce, coffee, and other good to neighbouring towns. This activity allowed them to learn Spanish while keeping to themselves. During World War II, the war declared on Germany rose the suspicions of government officials. So, roads were improved so officials could travel to and from Colonia Tovar with ease. Spanish was established as the official language, and German was banned. 
With a population of roughly fifteen thousand, Colonia Tovar is considered one of the country''s most prosperous towns in terms of economy and quality of life due to their integration combined with cultural preservation. The culture shock was quite disorienting. “I did take a plane for South America, right?”, I jokingly asked the group. However, my growly stomach stole my full attention as I could not help but salivate on the smell of hearty German cuisine of sausage and sauerkraut -German pickled cabbage- lingering in the air. We parked the cars and marched to the Hotel Bergland for lunch. 
Soraya, the Lebanese security advisor sat in front of me. Her long wavy hair seemed familiar; my father reminded me that I participated in women''s security and emergency response training, where she mentored a self-defence and crisis management workshop.  Thomas was on my right, quiet until we started discussing our encounter with the heavily armed patrol. They were driving ahead of us. He was just as skeptical about our encounter and believed some of them were Colombian soldiers. To finish our meals, we sipped through a hot espresso to fight the urge to nap and headed towards the food market. 
The village had installed stalls with local fruits, vegetables, cookies, and sweets. There was even the famous Willy Wonka, waving at visitors with a golden ticket in his hands. We stopped by a souvenir shop, and a sunflower wind-chime caught my attention. The shop owner took an old geometry book and tore some pages to wrap our gifts. “I never cared for mathematics”; she laughed. She quickly noticed my careful silence and asked me if I was a foreigner. “We came from Caracas”, Sofia intercepted. “It is best to be discreet, not many foreign tourists at the moment”, she whispered in my ear as we quickly but respectfully left the shop. 
Our way down the mountains was obstructed by a thick fog. The side streets were more animated than earlier. Young adults were waving meat skewers, and we drove past a few stands offering alcoholic beverages. The traffic got busy. It was Sunday afternoon, everyone was heading home and savouring the last bits of the weekend. Sofia, my father, and I were dropped off at the hotel. Valentina suggested that we walk down to Altamira Plaza to try some of the food trucks stationed there. “Platanos are the best!” She waved and drove off. Sofia was more than happy to accompany me. 
El Topocho''s design immediately attracted my eye. It was a matte black truck covered with large paintings of banana tree leaves. Sofia and myself followed Valentina''s suggestion, and we ordered a box of six ‘plataconcitos’. The recipe was simple enough. The plantains were deep-fried, shaped into cups, and packed with different kinds of fillings. My favourite was the guacamole because it was lighter than the others. The plaza was busy, and my father who started to get worried, joined us minutes later, before we walked back together. The sun was setting, so we avoided looking around as we moved towards the hotel with purpose and the most unsuspicious fast pace we could do.

'What is a humanitarian?',
'image3.jpg',
'The morning after our visit to Colonia Tovar, I briefly attended a staff meeting with my father. The conference took place at the Marriott Hotel in Caracas. Thomas stopped at the drop off zone, just in front of the entrance. The lobby was sumptuous, and a few guests were seated in the lounge area. A few glances traveled our way, but we marched forward without looking around. Inside the event room, a few large round tables had been set around a large, white drop screen. 
I sat at a round table with strangers and got my camera set up. I shyly greeted two young men in Spanish and gave a warm hug to Soraya who sat next to me. “It''s going to last for a few days, but I am leaving in an hour”, she whispered. In brief, they would focus on overcoming challenges that had to do with their image and their recognition. The government and the political opposition did not trust foreign aid at the time; so the conference hosts needed to promote and encourage the use of tools that are rooted in social and cultural awareness.
“Do you want to go to the barrios?”, Hind’s eyes glistened with excitement. “Who will be your guide?”, I asked while packing my camera away. “Maybe Thomas. I have not planned the visit yet”, she looked in the direction of the guest speaker and crossed her arms. “Ah!”, she swiftly turned closer to my face. “I located a salsa festival. The last party is tomorrow, but it could be a good excuse to sneak away with colleagues”, she spoke loudly enough that a few heads turned.  “Why not? Let me know if there are any updates”, I said softly while standing up from the table. 
I spotted my father leaving the conference room, and I quickly followed so we could share a ride to his office. There was barely any traffic, and all the cars had tainted windows. I isolated myself on a couch,  in the far left corner of his office. I took notes, fumbling down things I did not want to forget from the last two days. I made acquaintances with Melanie who assisted my father while Daniela recovered from her injury. Learning that I had an affinity for filmmaking, she introduced me to the media team. 
Maria is the audiovisual director; she was working on some promotional videos when we interrupted her. There was a picture of a young Venezuelan mother holding her baby. She had tanned skin, and her short permed hair was tied behind her head. A few strands had escaped from the up-do. In the accompanying video she gave a testimony on the benefits of vaccinating her child. Maria was unhappy with that take. She could find footage that satisfied her creative eye. “I don’t feel the ''motherly care and attention'' in this video. Do you?”, she glanced at me. 
It’s true that the woman looked slightly detached. Perhaps, anxious about how she would provide for this new fragile life in this unpredictable and hostile world. I could only assume some of the thoughts that troubled her, but I had no doubt that the most dreadful ones had emerged. She could cross the border for work; leave her infant to a caretaker, her oldest child, or an orphanage. Worse -and this might break your heart as well- discard it in a dumpster. I thought that this kind of responsibility weighted heavily and solely on the mother’s shoulders.  
Sensing that I was captured by distressful contemplation, Maria snapped me back to a different topic. “Let me show you…my current…passion project”, she clicked a few times and opened a desktop file. She scrolled through videos, looking for the right footage, while she told me the story of this cocoa farm in Birongo, Miranda state. It''s a five to six hours drive from Caracas. During her visit, she filmed the women''s celebration of the San Juan holiday. There was a majority of Afro-Venezuelan women in the footage. I was particularly enticed by the sound of the drums and the women dancing around the statue of a child-saint, which was carried around the village. 
The enslaved Africans who were brought to Venezuela and worked in coffee and cocoa plantations were permitted three days of rest from their daily labour. In honour of holy Catholic figure Saint John, the African slaves came together to eat, play music, dance and rejoice to commemorate their own traditional heritage. The festival is still celebrated today among the Afro-Venezuelans communities in a mixture of Catholic tradition and mystical African customs.  
Maria took me to an Italian restaurant  which was a short walk away. She asked if they served a locally famous Venezuelan Christmas dish. “Not yet, maybe next time” our waiter responded. “You have to ask the waiters very nicely if you want something with your order”, she waved with her hand to call our host and wielded a mellow voice to ask for ‘something extra’. Moments later, she was delighted to see he had ‘found’ tomato sauce to accompany her gnocchis. “I know that the situation here is terrible”, she added. Her friends have all left and found employment overseas. “When we have group calls, they try to convince me to leave. I always tell them that I don''t want to leave”, she said contently.   
As we walked to the cash register to pay the bill, I attempted to pull two dollar notes out of my wallet; but she quickly pushed my hand back in my bag. She gave her credit card and the waiter started to walk around the restaurant with the terminal, hoping to find signal in the highest corners of the vicinity. In a general sigh of relief, we smiled as we heard the sound of printer paper; everything was cash dominated, so if your card worked it was a good day. 
We walked outside the venue at a brisk pace. I was focused on the conversation, but briefly took notice a motorcycle that drove past us. I paid no mind to the rider suddenly stopping further down the street. Maria who was much more alert, gripped my hand firmly and started retracing our steps back to the restaurant. “Quick! Quick Quick!” I followed at her heels. We crossed the street, but stopped in the middle so to not get hit by a passing car. One of the men, got off the bike and walked into a building. The conductor rode back in the direction from which they came—no more danger within seconds. Maria stopped, relaxed her strong grip on my fingers and inspected discontentedly my all black attire.“You need to dress more simply. More jeans and t-shirts. Got it?”. I was extremely startled but I answered with a small nod. She walked forward and I spent the rest of our walk scrutinising every woman’s outfit. 
Back at the office, we helped each other pick the best picture destined for promotional value. Her supervisor stubbornly asked for an image which was not her first choice. “I like my job, but I wish it were less about branding”, she pouted. We both preferred the picture illustrating the warm smile of a volunteer. We sat in silence while I let her do her work and wrote some more. My father had returned from his lunch meeting and asked if I wanted to head back to the hotel. I said goodbye to everyone I met and joined him in the parking lot. “I was not supposed to be working this week. This conference was supposed to be a week before your visit. I just want to spend time with you”. The disappointed gaze and darkened eyelids of my old man glanced back at me.
Back at Altamira, we got a phone call from Melanie. With a balanced amount of control in her shaky voice, she informed us that Maria got into a car accident with her mother. She won''t be able to come in for work. Nothing grave, but she had to get stitches. The mood sunk further that night as we each poured ourselves a glass of whisky and meditated to the sunset show. Valentina''s words echoed in the air as I sipped on the bitter brown liquid. “Life must go on”.'

'“The economy sucks here”, said Valentina as she sipped on a red bull can. We were filing up at a petrol station before heading out to El Hatillo. “When people can''t pay fuel with money, they can pay with food. I gave a pack of eggs once; I was in a hurry” Valentina put down her can and looked for her wallet. She bend towards her feet, and her hair shone in the sun for a moment. A man was waiting by the window, I smiled and awkwardly lifted my hand. She paid the equivalent of fifty cents in bolivars to fill up her tank. It''s too cheap, for a country with oil reserves recognised as the largest in the world. My guide handed a few notes and changed gear.  
“Country Club”, I read. “We are in an expensive area; right before El Hatillo”, Isabel explained. She instructed to not take my camera out of the window. There were quite a few cars in the parking lot, which meant that many were still able to enjoy such luxuries. We stopped on the way to look at a strange-looking church. I found out later through a bit of research that the ‘Church of St Constantine and Helena was was donated by the Orthodox Church of Venezuela and the Government of Romania to the Orthodox community living in Caracas. The structure is intended to be a replica of the wooden church of Surdesti, the highest in Romania. 
Everything was closed in El Hatillo so we quickly walked around the Plaza Bolivar and stopped by the house of the town’s founder, Baltazar de Leon. I noticed the various bright coloured walls of the townhouses. “A few years ago, this place was busy, and people were queuing to walk into every store”. I could do not see her expression behind her sunglasses, but I heard the slight nostalgia in her voice. “Come with me. I want to make sure that the souvenir shop is closed”. As expected the shop was closed and  we walked back to the parking lot slightly disappointed. “We''ll come back tomorrow”, I cheered loudly as I discreetly observed the policemen stationed under a colonial style house; hoping they hadn’t seen noticed my camera. 
Moments later, my eyes gravitated towards a pink round-shaped object. It was a donut shop. Neither Valentina or myself could resist, and it was the perfect shelter from the sudden rain shower. I picked a donut and thanked the young woman who served me. “Merci!”, I blushed from embarrassment and desperately wished any Spanish word came out instead. “Derien”, the cashier answered back clearly. Taken by pleasant surprise, I asked where she had learned French. She happily explained that she has lived with her Algerian family for a while. At the time, she was young enough that the French stayed permanently; although she practices when her father calls for news. 
At Hacienda la Trinidad Parque Cultural, Valentina guided me to another souvenir store that might be of interest. The place is closely linked with the history of Caracas and its founder Diego Losada. The land was previously occupied by indigenous people in the Valle del Cacique Baruta, until it was assigned to Alonso Andrea de Ledesma. These lands would provide four centuries of agricultural ventures, starting with wheat, then coffee, sugar cane for the eighteenth century, and tobacco for the middle of the 20th century. In 1950, large scale agriculture stopped for the rise of oil.
Its main buildings and its natural setting is a refuge for historical memory. The owners turned the place into a self-sustaining cultural centre that attracts the contemporary eye of the Caracas population. In its spaces, as well as in the gardens that surround them, exhibitions, talks, conferences, talks, workshops, recitals, and many other cultural activities occur. “I have tried a yoga class here”, Valentina pointed towards the Corphus Menti Health Center.
Inside the ‘El Secadero Uno’ building, we browsed through the colourful and various artisanal shelves. “There are two more floors!” I grinned as I climbed the stairs and marvelled at the wooden birds pinned up. On the second floor, there was an art exposition about José Gregorio Hernández. The story goes that a delirious patient described seeing the figure of a man with a hat during his illness. The patient recovered, and this mysterious silhouette birthed a deep-magical and religious longing for the Venezuelans. Valentina''s favourite building La Casa de Hacienda is closed. I won''t get to admire its beautiful gardens. “Are you hungry?”, my growly stomach responded quicker than my mouth did. She laughed loudly and announced that our next destination was lunch break.
The hair on my arms was rising inside el Restaurante La Casa del Llano; the air conditioner was blasting. “Are you feeling cold?”, Valentina rubbed the sides of my arms. “A little bit”. Lucky for me, the prospect of my first arepa could beat all climate conditions. “This place brings up good memories. My friends and I use to come to this restaurant after clubbing; then we would finish the night out sleeping on the beach the whole afternoon”, Valentina smiled pensively. I could almost feel the warm sand on my toes as I sipped on an icy lemonade. I wondered if I would ever get the chance to meet the Caribbean sea. Valentina ordered a plate with rice, black beans, local cheese, shredded meat, plantains, and avocados. Beaming with anticipation, I investigated my large arepa filled with chicken breast, avocado, and a secret sauce from the house. “I am so full!”, I chuckled as I wiped the corners of my mouth. 
We spent the early afternoon digestion time cruising inside the campus of the Universidad Simon Bolivar. Valentina’s brother used to study here. It''s a closed campus, with nearly three million and five hundred square meters of land of Sartenejas valley. The university is separated into two sections, one of them is a natural reserve. Valentina pointed to the different hiking trails starting from the center of the campus. The area stood at almost 1400 meters in altitude; the climate nourished its sumptuous gardens where a multitude of plants and birds were thriving. The Cúcuta campus was practically empty; however, it seemed the shuttles were still working. I discreetly peeked inside the blue empty school bus with my camera. People were most likely waiting for departure time.
Our visit coming to an end, we drove back into town, and Valentina walked me back to the lobby. “Is nine-thirty okay?”. “Not a problem”, I waved back. I collapsed on the bed and stared at the green carpet of my room. The history of the natives only lightly lingered in my journey so far. I secretly hoped to find more traces of the mother continent during my trip. The food coma took full effect, and I drifted off to sleep

'Isabel waited at the drop off area; this time we stopped at the  Chacao fruit and veggie market before El Hatillo. There were beautiful flowers and plants set up at the entrance of the commerce. Venezuelans love nature, and they refuse to compromise on the company of house plants. We looked for breakfast inside the market place, and we stumbled on an empanada stand. “The fish one is the best”, she smiled. It will be two fish empanadas for Valentina and myself. “Credit or debit”, the store owner asked. Valentina explained that some shop owners refuse credit cards as they can get a very expensive surcharge. “How many empanadas do you make a day?” asked Valentina as if reading my mind. “Less than what I use to do”, our host stared down at his frying pan. We combined this small but copious breakfast with a watermelon and passion fruit cocktail. 
The market looked like a two stories hangar. You could buy a bit of everything, from cheese to leggings. It reminded me of ‘Markets on Main’ in downtown Johannesburg.We grabbed a few coconut sweets and continued our visit. “You can find almost everything here, but most products cost roughly around a dollar”, Isabel notified. I spotted behind a few stone walls, a beautiful mosaic piece of the ''Mercado Municipal de Chacao, but my admiration was interrupted by a man singing near his avocado stall on my right. “Now you are not longer my coconut sweet” Valentina interpreted while laughing. He was heartbroken because we walked past his stall without taking a look. 
The sight of plantains made me crave ''aloko''; a dish of fried plantains very popular in most West African countries. This same dish is referred to as platanos in Venezuela; I took it as a small but important proof of the deep cultural ties between Africans and Latin Americans. We stopped at the next stall so that Valentina could buy some small bananas. “They are less sweet than normal-sized bananas and are great for portion control”, the fruit vendor explained. A one-kilogram stalk of bananas for 42,750 bolivares; that''s roughly fifty cents. “Let’s go. El Hatillo is waiting for us”, Valentina grabbed the plastic bag and we walked towards the exit. 
‘Hannsi Centro Artesanal’ is a reference in Caracas, and we were hoping that this reputed souvenir store would be open today. “Great! It''s open! I want to get a small statue of San Juan as a gift for your father. I hope I can find it here”, Valentina quickened her pace. 
It was souvenir store but it looked like a massive art museum. There was a coffee shop on the left where you could enjoy a small brew and grind your favourite beans. Only the staff was present at the moment. The first section of the store had all the Christmas ornaments, but we found statues of Miss Venezuela. We jokingly pretended to catwalk a few meters while browsing through the kitchenware section and the household objects. I suddenly stopped to admire a candle holder whose orange lighting made the paint beautifully contrast with the ceramics around it. I walked across the building and wilfully ignored the jewellery section to follow daylight. As I approached, I could hear the faint sound of water splashing. 
“This construction is a typical hut from our Indians”, Valentina raised her arm and her finger followed the shape of the straw hut standing tall in front of us. The structure built within the wall of the second section of the store comprised of souvenirs that supported the natives'' traditional artefacts, as well as musical instruments. The water fountains made this area so peaceful; I imagined myself at the gates of a new world. There was a painting of Salto Angel on my right, and a fish pond on my left. Woven baskets, maracas, pan flutes, and wooden piranhas, none caught my interest but the tiny little men that remind me of the Kakamoras in the Disney animation Moana. 
A blackboard on the upper shelf explained that these small figurines represented ceremonial masks of the Paroa, an indigenous native group. They live in different scattered areas across Venezuela as well as on the banks of the Orinoco River. Admired for their peaceful society and lack of hierarchy, Warime is considered the most important celebration for this group. It is a fertility ceremony in which shamans summons their mythical ancestors in the making of masks, musical instruments, and select clothing. Valentina silently observed me as I chose and humbly held in the palm of my hand a small carved and painted wooden plate representing the mask of Re''yo, the grandfather of the woods. “This one will be for me”, I whispered. 
As I gathered my souvenirs, Valentina let me know that she received a call from Felipe; inviting us to join their lunch with my father and colleagues from the conference held at the Marriott. “We can go, but first, we have to get you, your first cocada!" Back on the street of El Hatillo, we approached the owner of a small cart and ordered two of them. The origins of the drink are unknown, but Valentina believes it comes from the eastern region of Venezuela, where there was a big production of coconuts. The texture resembled a fresh smoothie, and although small pieces of coconuts got stuck in the corners of my mouth, I enjoyed the light sweetness of the drink. It was the perfect summer delight, on a cloudy day; just like ice cream in autumn.  
We approached the parking gate of the hotel and a guard asked the purpose of our visit. We vaguely mentioned the conference and descended three floors before finding a place to park. We struggled to find the conference room for a few minutes, but quickly found Felipe. Soon after, he introduced me to a handful of people and mentioned that I lived in Johannesburg to initiate conversations. The table topics varied between the conference, the political state of the country, worldwide concerns, and sharing experiences of their different international postings. Towards the end of lunch, Valentina asked if I would like to do some swimwear shopping. 
We wound up at her cousins'' house, where she had set up a small boutique. I chose a white one-piece costume and a straw hat; the products seemed to be of high quality, and the prices only confirmed my guess. Later, Valentina invited me to her house for a quick visit and showed me her favourite art projects. I got introduced to Rosa, who has been employed as a housekeeper in Felipe''s family for a very long time. “She is like a mother to the both of us. Always telling us to eat well and take good care of ourselves”, Valentina’s gently held her hands. Her smoky-grey hair waved in harmony with the creases on her henna like skin. She had a familiar energy, and smelled like incense. She smiled and offered me a glass of water before we all climbed into the car. We drove her to neighbour located on the edge of Petare, her final destination. It is one of the most violent barrios of Caracas. The leading cause of death among the youth is homicides and the more deprived areas of Caracas are the most affected, as many gang groups take control with weapons readily available. The deep socio-economic gap continues this cycle of violence, for only the wealthy have the means to protect themselves. 
“Will you be okay here?”, Valentina savagely bit her lower-lip with worry. “Don’t worry”. She exclaimed as she slammed the car door. I watched in amazement as Rosa explosively raised her clenched dark fist to the air, and walked away like Winnie Mandela. '

'Carolina -whom I had met upon my arrival in Caracas- called me in the early hours of the next morning. “I am sorry. I was absent, but I promise to give you the best tour of downtown Caracas”, she apologised. She completed the presentation of her master''s thesis yesterday and I congratulated her. It took me an hour to find an outfit that was both comfortable and did not attract too much attention. I knew that wearing my Africanism branded shirt was terrible idea. “Nothing screams ‘tourist’ more than a printed shirt with bold letters”, I muttered to myself. I did not want to attract any attention, but something in me needed to wear something that represented the journey I am on and the answers that I seek. 
Carolina picked me up and took the highways surrounding the city. She pointed towards the Caracas Metrocable climbing up the steep green hills. “It was set up by the government so that workers from the San Augustin barrios could easily reach the city and the subway network. Today not many use it, and the station is closed in the late afternoon for security reasons”, explained Carolina. We picked up Carolina’s friend on the way. Diego slided into backseat and excused himself for his poor English. I apologised for my ‘non-existent Spanish’ which quickly lightened the shy atmosphere. 
We left the car in a parking building and wiggled our way out of the bustling street entrance. I gave all my attention onto walking with purpose. Not looking at things or people too long; one of the few tips I had learned from friends while walking the city center of Johannesburg. “You have to pretend as if I you have walked this street more than a thousand times in life”. Although I was glad to remember my friend Mark’s street walking lessons, the truth, was I had no idea where we were going but I didn’t not want to be targeted as a tourist. Carolina took left on a narrow street and I found myself walking through a long and tight corridor with walls of multicoloured clothes raising high on either side of my body. The path ended on El Venezolano plaza and the white walls of The Bolivarian Museum stood out next to an elegant ancient stone road. 
“Africa resists in American”; the title of this black marble description plaque made my heart pound. I learned that Africans enslaved in America developed many ways to combat the iron regime of Europeans and White Creoles. The arts of dance, theatre, and crafts -tolerated or permitted by the masters- were a powerful weapon that claimed a deep and inalienable identity. Under the appearances of Christianity -meaning despite the riots and images of Christianity imposed by force- the slaves continued to give life to their customs and gods. Those who managed to flee forced labor found refuge in clandestine communities such as the Cumbes and the Cimarroneras. Wanting to avoid these escapes, the masters tolerated certain areas of freedom that included dances, religious services, and meetings. 
I stared deeply into the shackles displayed under glass but ignored the slaves’ clothing displayed on mannequins. I can say with strong certainty that I will never have endure being captured, caged, dehumanised and enslaved for countless of years, but I would without hesitation watch those fabrics burn with no remorse and dance on the remaining ashes. I took many pictures of a poster on the system of slavery, when I noticed that my companions had been quiet since we entered the slavery section of the museum. “What do you think of slavery and racism?”, I asked feigning innocence in my voice. 
Diego thought it was terrible and  still a massive problem in the world today, but he did not think it applied to Latin America. Carolina  added that many people here are mixed race, and so the lines were blurred. “If I call a friend affectionately ‘negrita’ -the direct translation being little black girl- she won''t be sensitive about it; but words like that have a racist meaning in other countries”, she said with confidence. There was much I could have said on the topic, but I believe that while traveling abroad it is often wise to avoid certain subjects, especially with acquaintances.  
After a quick walk around through the rest of the museum, we walked a few meters down the last paved street of Caracas to visit the house where Simon Bolivar was born. The furniture was vintage, which was very typical of the period. There were large paintings by Tito Salas that summed the history of America and the heroic life of  El Libertador, like his marriage in Madrid or the earthquake of 1812. 
We walked a few meters around Plaza Bolivar before entering the Museo Sacro of Caracas. This carefully restored colonial building stood on the vestiges of the old cathedral cemetery. It displayed carefully selected collections of carvings, furniture, objects of worship, paintings, ornaments, etc.. Centuries ago the old cemetery of Caracas cathedral was built in 1673, at the time it was custom to bury the deceased inside the churches and cathedrals. Today, you can see crypts in which the remains of the first bishops of the city were presumably found. During an archeological excavation between 1988 and 1989, they found a mass grave of approximately 25 corpses. Spooky! 
I feel slightly unsettled when I suddenly took notice of a man who I believed was at the Casa Bolivar Museum earlier during our visit. I recognised the baby blue shirt, the slender body type, and his medium height. I pretended to scrutinise the description of the artefacts so I could observe him discreetly. He looked suspicious, and he was diligently texting on his cellphone while glancing briefly in my direction multiple times. He dropped his arm and walked in my direction, and I nervously took a few quick steps towards the exit of the crypt. The pathway was  too tight, so he had to drop his arm to walk behind me. Our bodies were close and I tried to squeeze myself closer to the wall of the crypt. I looked up to meet his eyes and held my gaze, but he smiled slightly and looked down. He walked past me and I took this opportunity to take notice of what I believed was my Instagram page lighting on his screen. “Kidnapping express is a booming business in the city”, Alejandra’s warnings resonated in my gut. Could I have been a carefully selected victim? 
Once I was out of the crypt, I discreetly signalled his presence to my city guides. They reassured me that he won''t be able to act if I have spotted him. I found calmness in knowing that I was not alone, knowing that the streets were busy today, the police was everywhere, and my friends would keep an eye out. The guardian of the museum, who was a man of a certain age, interrupted our conversation; he told us that we could see bat eggs inside the outdoor crypt next to us! It took Carolina and myself a few minutes to remember that bats do not lay eggs. My rapidly beating heart slowed down as my body relaxed under the endorphin boost of a good laugh. 
Suddenly, I felt the alarm of my growling stomach. What''s for lunch? Diego got my tastebuds buzzing as he carefully described a typical Venezuelan Christmas dish. Before that, we shared a plate of Barriga, which was composed of plantains, small lettuce, chicken, salami, and boiled cassava. Katie and her friend made a soda and beer cocktail that I found refreshing. It tasted like summer watermelons, the fizzy bubbles of Perrier and there was not enough alcohol to get tipsy. I felt like my stomach was going to explode, but I still followed them to Plaza Bolivar to try some street food. “It’s time to try ‘hallaca’, my friend”, Diego’s smile widened. The most popular origin story of that dish tells that the slaves created it during colonial times. They would put their masters'' Christmas leftovers in cornmeal dough; wrap the mixture with banana leaves and boil the wrap to mix in the flavours together. 
I took a small bite of Diego''s cachapa; a dish even older than hallaca as it dates back to pre-Columbia cultures. The indigenous populations would grind corn with stone pestles, mix it with water or milk and cook it on flat griddles. This sweet and yellow pancake is served with hand-made cheese -queso de mano.
We finished our meals in the car as we had to rush back to Altamira. My father had set up a meeting with the director and founder of the Center for African, American, and Caribbean knowledge; I did not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. To my surprise, the building was on the left of Museo Sacro de Caracas; which means we did not have to drive to the hotel. I could have avoided being unnecessarily scolded by my father if we had simply communicated. We were late and so Thomas parked the car in the middle of the street, my father and his assistant greeted a friendly, tall, suited dark man. Inside the center, our attaché introduced us to Reinaldo Jose Bolivar. He used to be the country''s vice minister of foreign affairs. 
We had a small tour of their offices as he pointed to the different masks, fabrics, musical instruments, and other West African artifacts displayed along the long corridors. The institute focuses on educational programs centred around teaching, strategic researching, production, management, and dissemination of knowledge related to Africa and its diaspora in America. The friendly staff of the institute is dedicated day and night to promote activities that create assimilate and spread awareness through research and teaching, promoting linguistic and cultural integration for sustainable development. The tall man and my father energetically exchanged their opinions on the possibility of  future and past alliance between South American and African governments. 
Reinaldo Bolivar gently cupped my elbow with his hand, as we walked away from our small welcome committee into a smaller corridor. He opened a door to gallantly let me enter first, but I froze for a few seconds. I don’t like entering rooms when a stranger is behind me -man or woman- but he stood with such humbleness and irreproachability that I obliged. The air that rushed in my lungs was perfumed with a light scent of sage. I spotted the the traditional incense burner on the ground and stood motionless, fixing the ground as if waiting for permission to look up. The totems reigned in this place of worship and it felt like a thousand eyes were watching my every move. “People from all kinds of religious belief come and pray here”, Reinaldo smiled. “Thank you for snapping me out”, I thought. I was mildly surprised to find in the next corner a mosaic painting illustrating a Muslim prayer mat, facing Mecca. 
Later that night, I tossed endlessly in my bed as I interacted with the heavy traffic of thoughts in my mind. After this visit, I became certain that Africa did reside inside the heart of Latin America, and this place is proof of that. For many, it was not so evident that the historical impact of the slave trade had rippled through time to influence the country’s social and cultural identity. How can two contradicting views existing at the same time; and is one more true than the other?'

'This morning I had the chance to have my very first Venezuelan cooking lesson, and we were preparing the infamous arepas. Carolina was our leading chef; she had already made the dough but encouraged me to dig my fingers so that I could remember its texture. She could shape the arepas into small pancakes using both of her hands; I required a little bit more assistance, so Daniela showed me how to construct my arepa on a round piece of plastic that she cut off from the maize pack. “You smash it down and with one hand press and turn the dough; at the same time, you shape it circular with the side of your remaining hand”, she instructed. 
Wanting to make our breakfast healthier, we filled our arepas with tuna, chopped spring onions, tomatoes, and a squeeze of lemon. I eventually managed to make my arepa by hand, after a fervent belief that food tastes better when made with the ‘palms of love’. My grandmother would often say that it is the secret of delicious dishes. “We are going to walk around a lot, so you have to eat a lot, and I will also bring some snacks”, said Carolina as she poured more orange juice in my glass. 
The National Pantheon is an elegant piece of architectural design, although the Libertador Mausoleum was not hard to notice with its white ceramic and steel design. The guard posted at the foot of the steps explained that there was a commemoration ceremony being held for the sixty-third anniversary of the Landing of Granma. The Cuban Embassy was holding a floral offering before the sarcophagus that retained the mortal remains of Simón Bolívar. Fidel Castro led the Granma expedition, and its purpose was to command the armed struggle against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista (1952-1959) until overthrown.
“We will return later to take some pictures”, said Carolina disappointedly. She guided me towards the Biblioteca National de Venezuela, where she hoped to find a few expositions still open. We walked through the islands of garden and observed the busts of various philosophers. “I used to walk my first dog in this area; the place used to be buzzing until people left the country”. She looked longingly into the distance. “Can I have a picture?”. I asked grinning. Her face slowly lighted up as she raised her eyes to meet mine. “Yes! Let’s do pictures!”. 
The first exposition room we walked into was named after a famous politician and lawyer; unfortunately, there was not much to see except for an old flatbed editor and projector. Thankfully, a kind gentleman guided us to more compelling grounds as we entered the main entrance of the library. Before we could begin, we had to leave our belongings in a designated storage box, and we had to present the ticket that they had given us if we wished to get them back. 
The elevator took us to the floor, dedicated to the audiovisual archives of the national library, where we were surprised by the nativity scene created by the staff. There was a document pasted on the metalling plaque standing next to us. ”Estampas Caraqueñas," a miniature representation of Plaza Bolivar, which I had visited the day before.
They had assembled emblematic buildings with symbolic characters such as Dr José Gregorio Hernandez, the mysterious doctor of the poor that appeared in a dream, explained Carmen Silva in her introduction piece written for the project. The piece was well written and rich with elaborate description. “Discussing with Carmen must feel like an intellectual treat for the brain”. “I would also like to meet her”, Carolina agreed. A tall, brown skin woman in a black pencil skirt and red heels approached and enquired on the purpose of our visit. I could sense an intimidating and yet serene aura behind her reading glasses. Carolina explained that I was originally from Senegal, and that we came to visit the library''s audiovisual archives because I am a film graduate. She smiled with her eyes, glanced at her watch and asked if we had twenty minutes to spare.  
“Sientate un momenmito”.  Our authoritative guide asked us to sit a moment while she accompanied another woman towards the elevator. Carolina  walked towards another visitor who seemed to be taking notes on a wooden desk. “Buenas”. We quietly greeted him in unison. We asked if we could take a look the black and white pictures set down in front of him. “I am a reporter for the education ministry, and we are making a television series that introduces influential personalities who worked for that department. Rómulo Gallegos was the country''s president in 1948 but is also considered as the best representative of Venezuelan literature”. He as if had been waiting for our interview and he pointed delicately with his latex glove at a man in the middle of a crowd. “He was a famous but humble novelist and advocated strongly for quality education”, Carolina confirmed.  
We parted ways with the reporter with a casual kiss of the cheeks. “I think he was happy to see we cared about this topic”, Carolina said as we followed the pencil skirt lady armed with clinical gloves walking promptly towards the archive room. 
In this air measured room, they kept all the essential documents that they wished to preserve from time degradation. In the almanac collection, our host pulled a drawer full of calendars from different years. She walked quickly and pulled another drawer where they had stored old movie posters. Pointing to her right is a section that held plans of public constructions dating back to the end of the 19th century. I felt privileged to be here as we looked through agendas, drawings, maps, photo collections, and many more of the treasures she carefully shared. She quickly turned towards at me while I was looking at the photo collection shelves of the 19th century. “Oh!” She exclaimed softly as if she had just returned to the present moment. “I know of a picture you might like; it is also my favourite”. Guzmán Blanco laid on his death bed in Paris. President of Venezuela for three full terms, he revived the economy of the country after the end of the civil war and organized an orderly government for modern developments. His most ardent efforts were directed towards the Catholic church by affirming the responsibility of the government to handle births, education, and marriages. However, he was also known for his dictatorship as he committed many brutalities to eliminate any opposition. It was an original picture and a real piece of history; she delicately returned the image inside the box and closed the lid. 
The visit is over and Carolina took extra time thanking her in Spanish. I shyly thanked her as well, and quietly observed the interaction. Kathy shook her hand one last time and asked for her name. “Carmen Silva”, she said matter-of-factly. Kathy’s eyes widened, and I moved closer to the group. “You wrote about the nativity scene displaced upfront?”, I asked in a broken Spanish while fiddling with my camera. “Yes, I did. Did you like it?” Carmen’s eyebrows slowly relaxed. “We loved it”. 
While exiting the library, and I stopped to record a video of a few drawings dedicated to Hugo Chavez. “See the posters with guns?”. I stopped recording as I heard Carolina''s disapproving voice. “They teach people violence; I don''t like that”. I knew that the debate on the justification of violence could be especially lengthy when not given a specific context. I walked closer to Carolina whose eyes were still fixed on the wall. “Which one do you like?”. She blinked and looked to her left. Walking slowly she stopped in front of one of the frames. It was a painting of flower growing inside the barrel of a gun. “That one”. 
The facade of the National Pantheon went through various style changes from colonial to Neo-Baroque and had three towers. The interior of the building had a central nave and two lateral ones with a marble floor and geometric designs. You could find burial slabs of essential figures of Venezuelan history; their names were engraved on the marble tiles. The building represented the importance of the iconography of the hero for the country. Although Simon Bolivar was the most celebrated, they made sure not to forget other freedom fighters. One of them was Pedro Camejo, also nicknamed Negro Primero which roughly translates to ‘black first’. 
He was largely celebrated in the black communities of Venezuela, because of his presence as a soldier in the war towards independence from the Spanish. Before joining the cause, he was a lieutenant leading armed groups for the Spanish army; feared by Simon Bolivar, he had the reputation of being swift with weapons and trained excellent soldiers. After realizing that the war for independence was a more significant cause to fight, Pedro cut ties with the Spanish royals and joined the opposition.
He was heroic; no doubt about it.  However, what I loved most about his story is that he seemed closer to his humanity than the rest. Imperfect Pedro was fighting for the Spanish before joining the rebellion, he could have won the war and with it a few social advantages. Instead, of thinking about what he could gain from being on the strongest side, he opted for justice and did what was the right thing to do for the future of the country. 
On the night of July 16, 2010, the remains of Simón Bolívar were exhumed from the National Pantheon at the request of the then President, Hugo Chávez. The operation had the objective of verifying if the cause of his death had been tuberculosis. A day later, Chávez announced the decision to build the Libertador Mausoleum, a building annexed to the National Pantheon, where Simon Bolivar''s remains will be housed. The two buildings were connected through a tunnel situated on the north wall. It was built with reinforced concrete and then joined with another one made of glass walls. In the middle of the luxurious granite floor of the building stood three statues; Simon Bolivar in the centre, Justice on the right, and Magnanimity on the left. Four soldiers in uniform stood on either side of his burial site. “I hope they don''t have to stand here all day”. Carolina read my mind once again.
We left the pantheon and managed to quickly sneak a few pictures by the Arco de la Federation constructed in 1985 to commemorate the Federal War. We drove past some of the famous landmarks of the city, the stairs of Parque el Calvario where they had painted the ''eyes of Chavez''; the Teatro Municipal de Caracas; as well as Basilica de Santa Teresa. 
We attempted a drive through Petare and unfortunately got stuck in traffic. From the safe space of Katie''s tinted glass car, I observed the inhabitants. I noticed a security agent with a hand on his pistol. He was speaking to two young adults, but when he noticed my camera his smile faded, and he quickly moved his hand behind his back. I remembered reading in my research an anecdote from El Negrito, member of the "Crazy Boys," one of the most notorious gangs of Petare who make money by kidnapping citizens. “If you empty your clip, you’re shooting off $15”. Firing a gun in Venezuela had become a luxury. “You see all these long lines of people at the bus stations?”. Carolina slowly glanced to the right so I could follow her gaze. The emotion on the passengers faces varied from worry to despair; I rarely noticed a smile, except for this of small children. “They are waiting for transportation, but we are not going to wait here as long as them”, Carolina explained as she turned the wheel. The military had blocked parts of the barrios, forcing us to drive back. 

Carolina walked with a quick pace towards the large window and set down a tray full of sunflower seeds on the floor. Her dog, Habibi, sniffed out the bird snacks and yapped at her tall owner. “No Bibi! Don’t make any noise!” She explained that we have to feed the macaws quietly because the upstairs neighbours doesn’t enjoy them. They arrived swiftly once the sun started to bathe in the night sky. Their vibrant plumages was mesmerising to the eye. I stood further away from the window so that they could get used to me. Then, I slowly got closer, exposing my right hand full of seeds. One of them swiftly moved towards me; gripping on the edge of the window with his large toes. I hesitated to present my hand, intimidated by those large strong beaks that are known to easily crack nuts. I hoped it wouldn’t be own of my fingers. I finally let me colourful friend dig inside my hand, I stood motionless in amazement. They looked elegant and unbothered by Habibi’s yapping. I felt a pinch inside my palm and jerked a little bit. My blue friend wanted to let me know that there were no more seeds to pick on. I eyed him sideways, “Don’t you worry sir, dessert will come out the kitchen any minute now”. 
After spending the afternoon feeding the colourful Macaws, we headed towards one of the shopping centres for a dance lesson. I was very clumsy on my feet and uncomfortable having my body so close to a man I barely knew. It was not my first time dancing this close, but I was in a country I did not know with a culture that I did not know. Which meant that I could not completely decipher whether my Kizomba partner was holding me too close or practicing proper technique. I struggled even more to communicate with them in Spanish because I was shy and clumsy on my feet. I would forget my words, and the music was playing loudly in my head. I noticed that everyone changed partners repeatedly, as there was only three man to dance with. I would stand by the wall and allow others to have a chance to practice. During these brief moments I was thankful for the evening breeze cooling my body. “How are you doing with your practice?”. Carolina asked with a joyful tone. “I am only thankful they weren''t tired of getting stepped on every five minutes”. Carolina laughed loudly and handed me a water bottle. “I’ve been watching you! You are ready to go clubbing!”. Carolina kidnapped one of the dance instructors and headed towards the car parked a few meters away. 
I was terrified and excited at the same time. I thought about the security advisor in South Africa warning us about the dangers of the night and emphasising on a curfew. I wondered if foreigners who didn’t speak a word of Spanish wandered out. Would I even meet foreigners there? Would I stand out? Would they be able to see that I am a fraud? I reassured myself that I did not have to speak. I can just grab a drink sit down somewhere. If Kathy wanted to dance I did not have to dance with someone else. I have mastered the art of dancing by myself. 
We arrived at the entrance of the night club and got stopped by a tall bouncer with very soft skin. “Identificacion”. He asked in a firm and loud voice. I felt so stupid. That was the only thing I did not think about. Pulling out a foreign passport was the most inevitable way to break my -already weak- cover.  I tried to seem as composed as I could be while I reached for my passport. Carolina was talking to him. You go girl! She was easing the scene for me. I pulled out the small item and he held a mild look of surprise as he opened it. Seconds felt like hours as he awkwardly looked for my picture. “Show him the page quickly”. Carolina’s voice had now moved right behind my left ear. I executed; quickly and without thinking too much about it. The people queuing behind us were starting to fidget forward to take a look at the scene. Here was the picture, with my face on it. I understood the word ‘tourist’ as he turned toward Carolina. She responded something about ‘amiga’. He closed it and slide to the left, revealing a set of stairs.   
The room was sleek, elegant and magnificently lit. I never got a chance to dance by myself. I met so many people with my body. Sharing a common movement and flow. Towards the end of the night, I sat down to admire their symbiosis and how comfortable they seemed. Sometimes it is better to watch others have fun, I wiped the sweat off my forehead and signalled Carolina that I was not sitting far. The club was packed but she managed to see my hand before a couple swung past, briefly obstructing our vision. Their bodies were so close as if they were trying to melt into each other. At the sound of midnight, Carolina dropped me back and Altamira, and we gave each other long hugs. “Have fun at Chichi” She waved from her car before she drove off.'

'"I am from here"',
'image8.jpg',
'My father and I rose at dawn, bags packed, and hats on. We had planned on spending the rest of our weekend in a small village called Chichiriviche de la Costa. 
We travelled with Jorge an ex-journalist and Sean an ex-agent of the British intelligence forces. The three men filled the short hour drive with many anecdotes of their work and family life. Sean’s Scottish accent was rarely heard during the trip because his back was very sore from all the bumps in the road. My father drove while Jorge was pointing out to the different landscapes. My father was initiating various subjects on politics, finance, expat life, and humanitarian work. . “Young lady. I want to hear from you now”. Jorge had slowly started to notice my presence; I assumed the reporter had realised that the discussions were very one-sided. He gave me valuable advice about the difficulties I faced at work and reassured me that it is only through hardship that we learn our best lessons in life. He talked about his eldest daughters and professed that they were intelligent and amazing women. “My youngest daughter of four is always warning us about climate change; coaching us on everything she learns in school.” He smiled and turned towards the backseat passengers with mock anguish in his eyes. “I’m very upset they are teaching these kids about this thing called composting; I can’t have worms swarming out my bin and attacking my tomatoes!” The atmosphere was light with laughter, and I began to pack my camera away. 
“We are going to stop here for breakfast before we lose network connection”, explained Jorge. “I already lost it”, I moaned. Sean who remained a keen observer despite his silence laughed at my complaint. The salty and wet air of the waves crashing on the small cliff filled my lungs. The smell of fish was present as I observed a man skinning a large-sized tuna hanging from the tree next to us. 
The owner of the small pub greeted us briefly as he served us the sauces and coffees from behind his counter. We settled ourselves on the only wooden table and waited for our meals. Although he barely paid attention to our little group, his Eastern European physical appearance had us privately guessing his origins. He confided to Jorge about his Croatian origin. It explained the ocean blue eyes.
I could still notice the lingering smell of fish empanadas on my cold fingers as I sipped on the last bit of my cocada. I wished I had another one, but we were already miles away. We started climbing the mountains and noticed that the road was getting rocky, and ever so small. On our right, some way down we could see the rocky ocean shore; I wondered if our car could survive the 800 meters fall. “Don’t look down”, my fathers said jokingly. The cliff was very steep, and Jorge was thankful that there was still a way to travel to our destination. He explained that the region was frequently affected by landslides caused to the heavy rainy season. We evidently encountered a flooded area which we managed to drive through. “You have to make sure not to turn off the engine, or else the water will get through and caput”! The rest of the fellowship nodded in unison with Sean’s advice, from having learned the lesson the hard way in the past. 
We drove past an abandoned holiday club. “Steep road and shortage of water supplies; no workers and therefore no clientele”. Jorge had not stop being the great road trip guide who knew many things.  After the resort, the trail got smoother. “Make sure your camera is ready”. Jorge looked behind.  
I admit to being a stubbornly dedicated fan of the barren, deserted land of the Saharian dunes. I like the emptiness. The great natural theatre where life and death play closely. The endless sky that makes you float in the deep dark night. Still, I could not keep my eyes off this Caribbean body of deep sea. The coastline reminded me of the curved lines children make when drawing a calm sea. The lines would get smaller as I looked further ahead. The endless green mountains of think jungle were interrupted by a small strip of sand. You could see a couple of housing structures but not a single building, a few fishing boats were travelling back and forth from the out-shore. The view must be breathtaking at the first break of light, but at this point in my journey, it would be challenging to trade a few hours of sleep. “Maybe I''ll see my very first whale shark on my dive today”. Jorge quickly gathered everyone back in the car. There was not a second to waste. 
The fellowship installed themselves under a shady area built with sturdy wood branches and straw roofs. The plastic chairs in which they sat, sunk in the soft hot sand. Sean was looking forward to some lobster and encouraged me to try some even if they seemed scary looking. Jorge passed by us in full diving gear, carrying two oxygen tanks. “I will be back later to refill for the late afternoon dive and lunch if the food is ready”. He slowly dropped them and waved before carrying them again. There was a woman who calmly admired the sea two chairs away from my father. I did not mean to stare, but I admired her natural features. “She looks like a Fulani woman”, said my father. She does, without a doubt. It was disorienting and peace-inducing all at once. 
“Señora", he timidly called. Her arms crossed, she slowly turned her head to the side and lifted her chin in a queenly manner. “I am sorry for disturbing you, but you look like a Fulani woman from Africa”, he said in very slow Spanish. She stared at me and she smiled. The curves of her lips slowly widened and showcased beautiful pearly teeth. She looked back at my father. “I am from here”. 
I was puzzled. I sunk my feet deeply into the hot shiny sand. Why would she say that she is from here? It is obvious that she is from here, but what would she say that to him? There’s something else. She was extremely serene and content in her answer. As if she did not need to know where she came from. I know that everyone wants to know where they come from. Scientists spend years studying the possible origin of humanity. On top of that many hold strongly to religion and nation and how they value our past as people. She was simply not interested to know more about whether she has Fulani origins or not. She was already convinced of her identity, and I found that so bold. 
Everyone worked hard although they seemed to do it effortlessly when looking around with the eyes of the privileged. It was easy to spot the locals, not only because most of them were doing some tourist-centred activity such as serving food, fishing, or selling some produce but mainly because of their appearance. The majority of them were tall, dark-skinned, with big kind eyes that so perfectly fitted their big loud laughs. I felt cheated; this place and these people looked nothing like the ''South America'' that I saw in images constructed by popular culture. Behind the magnificent pearly white beaches of music videos, there was a local population who worked hard to fulfil the needs of the big city people. I suddenly felt extremely undeserving of lounging here because of my privilege. I took a few deep breaths and looked at the blue water while I did a full body scan as instructed in my daily meditation practice.  
Although I wished I had travelled differently, my experience in the city allowed me to observe my surrounding with a more objective eye. This beach was beautiful, but it looked just like any beach I''ve seen on the coastlines of West African countries. Although, I must confess I had never seen sand glitter. 
The water was warm, but I still had to jump in to get accustomed to the temperature. I dipped my ears in the water and let my body float about. I had forgotten how many sounds could run your imagination under the water. A particular one caused my heart to double its pulse, the vibration it caused was unmistakable, I rose and begin to search for the round and earthy tones. I spotted a group of boys a few meters away, with two long, large, and bulky hand-made drums; and a smaller rock-band style one. In this drum circle, the players were connected, each one of them given the creative freedom to improvise, experiment and play. Actively or unknowingly, they were playing an ancient song of life and promoting a spirit of community as they shared this experience with the listeners, who had gathered in small numbers to take selfies, sit silently or encourage the group. Did they know how African they were, at this very moment? 
Towards the late afternoon, fishing boats started to land on the beach, bringing with them the lunch my group ordered a few hours ago. Inside the small ships, square tubs filled with pink-fleshed sea creatures glistened and reflected spots of light against the wet wooden bottom. Another appeared shortly after, and a man attempted to raise his catch by the fin tail but ended up needing the help of his fishing partner. The salmon was as tall as him. 
Many travellers gathered around and purchased what they need. One of Jorge''s diving friend bought two tubs of salmon that would be transport back to the city tomorrow. All payments were made in cash, as it was rare for credit card machines to work. A 2018 article from The Washington Post explained that some had to travel a mile out to sea to catch a faint signal that would hopefully process credit card transactions. This far out, the only thing you can do is trust each other in the exchange. One needs to feed his family, and the other needs to keep his business running. The hunt was fruitful, and the village spent the night drinking, cheering and dancing around fire camps while eating the fruit of their hard labour. 
I retired to the suite that my father decided to rent after spending the day talking to the owners of the guest house. It was expensive, but he wanted to isolate us from the group so that we could have more family time. I slowly climbed the crumbly and sandy steps of the building. People lived close to each other and I could hear loud giggling and protestation in the darkness. It was very noisy and I struggled to sleep, so I kept focusing on the sound of the waves crashing on the sand.

'Our similairty is our diversity',

'The Posada Oceánica was located on the ocean front, near the natural pool section where divers checked their tanks before diving towards the reefs. The sun gently lighted the soft white walls of our guest room. I''ve missed the sunrise, but most fishing boats were anchored on the beach. I was not the only one who liked to sleep in. 
I gently let the wooden door of the veranda creak itself open and sat on one of the sun loungers to meditate on a small line of clouds that I could see between the horizon and the sea line. Minutes later, I could hear voices over the sound of the ocean, slowly activating the stillness of the moment. I remembered Sean mentioning that he preferred to use the fresh morning mist to do some fishing, as the sun was not so kind on his pale skin during the day. 
I slowly climbed down the small, grainy steps towards the beach. Reaching the restaurant area, I attempted to put my foot down softly so not to attract attention or waken someone. I met Daniel, the owner of the oceanfront at the foot of the wooden stairs. I froze and looked to my right to find Judy''s eyes, his wife. “Would you like a cup of coffee?” They asked me if I slept well and if I was not too cold. The slightly warm salty air was perfect for sleeping, but I kept waking up to the resonant voices of the drunken fishermen celebrating under our room. I had to turn on the air conditioner to numb the noise outside. 
“You should have told us”, Judy put down the wooden cups on her kitchen counter. 
The local waitress, whom the couple referred as ''Negrita'' elegantly picked them up and gently handed me one. She had gorgeous dark brown curly hair that embellished the beautiful folds of time on her dark skin. Our eyes barely met as she bolted towards the beach; the colourful flowers on her dress moved to the rhythm of the gentle wind flowing between her feet. 
I slid my fingers around the small semi-cylinder sticks that shaped the coffee cup. It is no secret that Venezuelan coffee is one of the best in the world. However, it was the subtle fragrance of clove tickling my nostrils that transported my mind to Senegal, where they also enjoy a spicy coffee called Café Touba. The black pepper used in this delicious Senegalese recipe comes from the dried fruit of Xylopia aethiopica, a tree from the Gulf of Guinea. 
The first time I had a cup of coffee I was on my way to an important high school exam. I lived in Dakar for 9 years and my parents had a driver and he always dropped us to school and picked us up after class. Other times, my mother drove when she wanted to attend important school meetings. He noticed the tiredness in my eyes because I had not slept so well the night before. He stopped on the side of the road and walked to a small cart, and gave a coin to a man with a black winter knit cap. He walked back to the car with two small pale orange plastic cups steaming from his hands. “Le café c’est bien quand il fait froid”. Coffee is good when it is cold. He smiled and handed me a cup. I felt nostalgic of this small form kindness.
My father and Sean joined me for breakfast as we each shared and plate of arepas with tuna filling, black beans and some local cheese. As we only had a few hours left before we returned to Caracas, my father asked Daniel if he could recommend a guide so that he could explore the village. He replied that he would let us know once he found someone available.
I took a stroll down the beach and found a large pool of water where the river met the ocean. The water was much colder, and the blend of colourful pebble and seashells added to this whimsical scenery. I returned to the guest house and found Sean staring at the water from a cemented platform where two little girls were fishing with their father. Among the leftovers of yesterday''s hunt, they were a few schools of multiple coral reef fish species. 
I improvised a small diving session of my own with Daniel''s snorkelling equipment. I spent roughly half an hour in the water until I got stung by what I supposed was a jellyfish. I vigorously rubbed my arm while I swam underwater, inspecting my surroundings. I was looking for filaments or a very scary fish. I did not find anything, and I assumed the perpetrator might strike again. I swam back towards the beach and immediately left the water. I didn’t want to take the painful risk. 
Daniel’s appointed guide was a small boy, no older than 12 years old. He presented himself as Johan. His quiet nature was no match for my father''s curiosity as he was encouraged to share the details of his life and the community dynamics of the village. Access to clean water was challenging, but the school was not far away from their homes. We walked alongside the river that I spotted hours ago, and at the entrance of the village was an altar dedicated to San Miguel. Head of the celestial militia, Archangel Michel was represented in armour, brandishing a sword, and defeating Satan or the demon who lied at his feet. 
This biblical event symbolised the victory of good over evil, humility over pride. I tried to remember if my expectations of this trip were influenced by pride. I humbly and quietly entered the village, feeling like an intruder. Perhaps my pride was that I wanted to explore the world of others as if it were an attraction. Taking advantage of the fact that I could always return to my privilege. In two days, I would be in my apartment in Paris, going to work, earning a salary and being able to afford another trip like this. I was unhappy with my life, but I felt ashamed about it. There were people who wished they could live like me, and they walked right past me.   
Further up, Johan pointed to his school on the left; a few steps over the hill, we reached the central plaza of the town where we found a church, an ambulatory care facility and a bust statue of Simon Bolivar. The sun had reached its zenith, and naturally, people preferred the cool shade although we could hear Cuban style music aired from a small pink coloured building on our left. We decided to explore a more religious structure first. We met a group of young girls on the steps of the church; they were making banners with bougainvillaea flowers and leaves to celebrate the end of the year. 
“Somos de Africa!”, my father interrupted. “Ella nació en Senegal”, he pointed to me. “¿Sabes dónde está Senegal?” The girls not knowing much about the African continent, and even less where to locate Senegal responded with a shake of their heads, he continued in English as he mentioned to Sean his project of bringing geographical maps of Africa to Afro Venezuelan communities. 
“I don’t understand you!”. The girl protested in Spanish. My father had quickly forgotten that the other participants did not understand English, and the eldest girl very much wanted to be included in the conversation. She brought the attention back to her and she was right. After all, she was the main subject of the conversation as well. 
We left the girls to their activities and walked towards the pink building to share a few dance moves with the professors of the music school. There was a poster on the wall with a drawing of a bottle. "Compre su ticket no hay fiao para nadien”. Sean and myself poorly interpreted it as a warning to credit purchases. 
The visit was over, and we headed back to the beach with Joan. My father handed him a ten dollars bill, and the boy curiously inspected the item between his hands. “No es bolivares”, he asked seriously. "Es dólares”, Sean explained. 
“Vale algo?”. 
Is is worth something?
“Mucho dinero”. So much money. 
The rough equivalent was of 2,500,000 bolivares; it was a very generous gift, with significant consequences in the hands of a young boy from a small fishing village. Was this a good thing to do? I moved the rice around the tomato-based fish sauce of our lunch. 
Unable to quiet my running mind, I excused myself from the lunch table and crawled up to the bedroom so I could finish packing. I didn’t particularly enjoy packing, but it allowed me to bounce my thoughts around freely, and without interruption. 
I am an African. There was no doubt in my mind about it. I was born there, tailored and shaped by multiple African cultures. None of them were the same and that is what shaped me into a traveler. Always curious about others and endlessly investigating our common humanity our shared similarities far and wide. The lesson that I was starting to accept from my trip was that our lineage or the place where we were born does not entirely define who we are. Although we share common ancestry our paths were never the same and that should be honoured just as much. In conclusion, I had found the courage to accept my uniqueness, and allowed myself to feel deserving of this life. 
I spent the ride in quiet contemplation. The next day, I would board a plane and I might never see these big green mountains again. I would talk about all these people that I met as if they were characters from a mysterious book. I would trivially keep contact through the internet, but I might not feel the weight or lightness of their daily lives. I would continue to be just a visitor, like wind passing by. Our memories of each other would vividly stay or they might get blurred by the time we spent separated. No matter what, we would still be who we are. We could always hold on to that. Our honest intricate lives.'
